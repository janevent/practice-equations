# practice-equations

This is an app designed with young learners in mind.  Want to memorize times tables, practice division, addition and subtraction?  I remember when I was young I needed help to learn and memorize simple equations.  My Dad created a simple app, turning developing basic math skills into a game on a computer(which was cool at the time).

In this app the user can earn stars and win games.  Users earn one point when getting one answer correct.  He/she earns one star for every 10 points.  At 100 points the game is won, with a status of complete.
